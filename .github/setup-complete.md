# Go to: Settings → Branches → Add rule
# Pattern: main
# Enable: Status checks, PR reviews, up-to-date branches
```

### 2. Add High-Priority Secrets (Recommended)
```bash
# Go to: Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
# Add: NPM_TOKEN (for publishing)
# Add: SNYK_TOKEN (for security scanning)
```

### 3. Create GitHub Environments (For Deployment)
```bash
# Go to: Settings → Environments
# Create: staging (no protection)
# Create: production (require reviewers)
```

### 4. Test the Pipeline
```bash
# Create a test PR to trigger all workflows
git checkout -b test/ci-cd-validation
echo "# CI/CD Test" > test-file.md
git add . && git commit -m "test: validate CI/CD pipeline"
git push origin test/ci-cd-validation
# Create PR and observe workflow runs
```

## 📊 Quick Validation Commands
