/**
 * Transport Layer Testing Strategy
 * ===============================
 *
 * The transport layer (stdio, http, sse) is considered infrastructure code and is tested via:
 * 1. Integration tests that spawn real servers
 * 2. Manual testing during development
 * 3. End-to-end tests in CI/CD
 *
 * Unit testing transports is challenging because:
 * - They depend on external MCP SDK modules that are hard to mock
 * - They perform I/O operations (network, stdio)
 * - The business logic value is in the tools/utils, not transport mechanisms
 *
 * Coverage focus is on business logic (tools, utils) where unit tests provide maximum value.
